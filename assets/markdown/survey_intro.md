The survey was carried among a list of **177 VC firms** which were using data science. It is still ongoing, feel free to contact me if you are a data science professional working in a VC firm willing to complete it (it shoud not take you more than 5 minutes).

The idea was to analyse the **maturity** and the **efficiency** of data science techniques used among VC firms.

Here are the questions asked in the survey, you can find the results on the next 2 tabs:

- To which extent are you using data science techniques in your fund ?
- Are you planning to deploy such technologies or to expand their use in the next 12 months ?
- If you use such technologies, during which steps of the investing process do you use them ?
- What are the main reasons driving your use of these technologies ?
- Which types of data sources are you using ?
- Which technologies are you using (algorithmes types, programming languages/packages, on-board solution) ?
- Do you consider that those technologies helped you to enhance the quality of your start-up investments ?
- If they did, how ?
- How long did it take to implement those solutions internally ?
- Do you encounter resistance to the implementation of data science techniques or to automatisation ?
- Do you manage to find/recruit profiles who both master the business side and the technical side of data science implementation ?
- Would you be willing to be contacted again for a brief interview in order to better understand the technologies that you are using ?
