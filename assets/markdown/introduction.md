Welcome to the companion app of my end of studies research paper.

### Subject

My research paper aimed to evaluate the **maturity** of the **data science landscape in the Venture Capital industry**. The goal was to see whether the industry is using those technologies, and at which step of the deal flow.

In order to get results, I ran a survey that I sent to **data science and software professionnals** working in VC firms. Since some of them asked for the final results, I designed this app to **share the document** as well as some additional plots in a dynamic manner. You can access the updated results of the still ongoing survey in the webapp.

### Sections 

There are 4 sections in this webapp :
- The **landing page**, with an introduction to the research paper and with a live view of the survey advancement;
- A page where you can **read and download** my research paper, as well as the slides of the oral defence;
- An **analysis** page, where you can find aggregated and anonymized descriptive statistics of the firms which answered the survey, as well as two interactive plots;
- A **presentation** page where I introduce myself.
