My name is Louis Bertolotti. I have just graduated from HEC Paris in the "Grande Ecole" Program in the [MSc Data Science for Business](https://www.hec.edu/en/master-s-programs/x-hec-programs/master-science-data-science-business-x-hec) with Ecole Polytechnique.

I have 2 years of experience in data science with 3 internships as a data analyst, as a data scientist/strategy consultant and as a data engineer, which gave me strong business and analytical skills in client-facing situations. I also give data analytics courses at DataBird, a bootcamp for data analysts. I am looking for a job combining a technical side and a client-facing role in data science.

I have an interest in Finance and in the Defence sector.
